<div class="about">
    <h6>Office Mi—Ji</h6>
    <p>
        {config.title} was established in Melbourne, but took shape in London and Chicago. With a clear motto of “do good work”, the office works with a straightforward motive that “good work” speaks for itself. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        MI—JI works equally across all breadths of architecture, approaching design collectively with an open mind, and formulating buildings that define a clear relationship with their contexts and their clients. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        With a strong commitment to simple, quiet architecture, MI—JI finds intrigue in the overlooked, hoping that an openness to architectural formulation and fabrication can have an honest and deliberate effect.
